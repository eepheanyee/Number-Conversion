# Solutions
So I was just typing away on my laptop the other day at work when I overheard my boss ask a colleague to come up with a function to convert numbers to words.
N.B: He writes Java and I do the "easy" Python.

I quickly asked if I could join in the challenge and he obliged. At first, it felt like it was gonna take days since I wasn't really much of a programmer, or so I always tell myself. About an hour later, I came up with a pretty decent algorithm that solved the problem.

Thinking back now, I have decided to take on little problem solving algorithms like this. Solve them and publish on this repo. Mostly t sharpen my problem solving skills but also to put it out there for anybody that might need them.
